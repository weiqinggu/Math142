						<h2>Final and Midterm Projects</h2>
						<br>
						<h3>Description:</h3>
						<p>
							This is by far the largest component of the course.
                            The final project usually continues the midterm project but could be  
                            a different project with different partners. 
							You will discover, explore, and attack a real world
							problem in Physics or computer vision of your choosing.
							There are <b> three </b> types of projects you
							can work on, shown below in order of increasing difficulty:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								(1) Application of existing algorithm to a new problem and
								potentially new data.
							</li>
							<li>
								(2) Algorithmic work. Extend an existing algorithm
	              or conceive a new one to solve some problem.
	              This inherently includes the first option because you will
	              need to test this new algorithm on data.
							</li>

							<li>
								(3) Theoretical work. Develop a new algorithm or new proofs of theorems in mathematical physics. 
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							These also have increasing risk. For example, you cannot
	            turn in a paper saying you worked on something but with no result. Option two has medium risk because
	            part of the process of creating a new algorithm is creating
	            baselines to improve upon.
	            At <i>any</i> time during the course <i>please</i> feel free
	            to come and discuss your problem and ask questions with the
	            instructor or TAs.
					</p>

					<h3>Requirements:</h3>
						All of the requirements below must be satisfied in order
						to receive full credits for the project:

					<ul>
						<br>
						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Partners:</i></b> <br>
							Work individually or with up to 2 partners. All
              partners must contribute equally.
						</li>

						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Report:</i></b> <br>
							Your submission must be a pdf in
							 <a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/PaperInformation/AuthorSubmissionInstructions">NIPS format</a>.
							 Note that this means you must use LaTeX with their
							 <a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/PaperInformation/StyleFiles">style file</a>.
							 (NIPS, Neural Information Processing Systems,
							 is one of the major machine learning conferences).

                             The midterm report should be at least <b>6 pages for individual students, 10 for teams of 2 and 12 for teams of 3</b>.
                             The final report should be at least <b>10 pages for individual students, 15 pages for teams of 2 and 18 for teams of 3</b>
						</li>
                        
                        <li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Presentations:</i></b> <br>
                            For individuals presentations will be 10 minutes long including time for Q/A.
                            For groups presentations will be 15 minutes long including time for Q/A.
                        </li>

                        <li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Submission:</i></b> <br>
                            Put all code, the PDF of the report and the latex code in a public github repository. Then send a link to the repository to gu@math.hmc.edu.
                        </li>
					</ul>


					<h3>Due Dates:</h3>

					<ul>
						<br>
						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Monday September 23rd &nbsp;Midterm Project Proposal</i></b><br>
							Typed (LaTeX)
              one page maximum explaining your problem, what data
              sets you are likely to use (you must find some candidates),
              who your partners are, and what methods (of those you know of)
              you think you might use. Note that this is not 100% final
              but it should be within some epsilon of your final project.
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Monday October 28th: &nbsp;Midterm Presentation and Report due</i></b><br>
                            Midterm report is due at the beginning of class and everyone presents in class on that day.
						</li>
						<br>

						<li>
							&#9679; <b><i>Monday December 9th 11:59pm: &nbsp; Draft of Final Project Submission</i></b> <br>
							Typed (LaTex) draft of final report and all of the codes written
							need to be submitted.
							The draft needs to detail the progress of the final project, which
							is expected to be a significant amount. The draft is
							used to demonstrate what you have done so far and show that you
							are ready for the final presentation.
							It does not need to follow
							the NIPS format (which is required for the final version).
							The code does not
							need to be super clean and organized for this draft submission,
							but it is expected to be cleaned up for final submission. You do
							not need to have the presentation slides ready for this submission.
                            Submit the draft by sending a link to the github repository to gu@math.hmc.edu.
