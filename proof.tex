\underline{Big Ideas}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*]
\item Differential geometry is concerend with those properties of surface which
  depend on their behavior in a neighborhood of a point
\item Accoding to our definition, each point $p$ of a regular surface belongs to
  a coordinate neighborhood
\item The point of such a neighborhood are characterized by their coodinates and
  we should be able to define the local properties of interest in terms of these coordinates
\end{enumerate}

A \textbf{diffeomorphism} is a differentiable function with a differentiable
inverse. \\

\underline{Change of parameters}
Let $p$ be a point of a regular surface $S$ and let $x: U \subset R^2 \rightarrow S, y: V \subset R^2
\rightarrow S$
be 2 paremterizations of $S$ such that $p \in x(U) \bigcap y(V) = W$. Then the change of
coodinates $h = x^{-1} \circ y: y^{-1}(W) \rightarrow x^{-1}(W)$ is a diffeomorphism. \\\\

To check that a function is differentiable check that the differential is
invertable. \\

Ladies and gentlemen! The times has come to give the definition of
\underline{\textbf{MANIFOLD}}: \\
An abstract surface (differentiable manifold of dimension 2) is a set $S$
together with a family of one-to-one maps $x_{\alpha}: U_{\alpha} \rightarrow S$ of open sets $U_\alpha
\subset R^2$ into $S$ such that,
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*]
\item $\bigcup_{\alpha} x_{\alpha}(U_{\alpha}) = S$. That is, the union over the images of the maps
  in our family of maps is the set $S$. So $S$ is covered collectivley by our
  family of maps.
\item For each pair $\alpha, \beta$ with $x_{\alpha}(U_{\alpha})
  \bigcap x_{\beta}(U_{\beta}) = W = \emptyset$, we have that $x_{\alpha}^{-1}, x_{\beta}^{-1}(W)$ are open
  sets in $R^2$, and $x_{\beta}^{-1}(W)$ are open sets in $R^2$, and $xx_{\beta}^{-1} \circ
  x_{\alpha}, x_{\alpha}^{-1} \circ x_{\beta}$ are differentaible maps
\end{enumerate}
The pair $(U_{\alpha}, x_{\alpha})$ is called a differentiable structure on the manifold.
