						<h3>Grading:</h3>
						<p>
                        <!-- &#9679; 5% Reading Presentations <br> -->
							&#9679; 35% Homework <br>
							&#9679; 20% Midterm <br>
							&#9679; 40% Final Project<br>

						</p>

						<h3>Course Requirements and Evaluation:</h3>
						<p>

							&#9679; <b><i>Homework</i></b> <br>

							The homework is due once a week at the beginning of each lecture.

							&#9679; <b><i>Midterm Project</i></b> <br>

                            The midterm project is to apply differential geometry to computer vision or Physics.
                            It can be theoretical or involve code. Each student will discover, explore and attack
                            a real world problem in Computer vision or Physics.
                            Everyone must submit a midterm report and give a presentation on Monday October 28th. 
                            You may work in individually or in groups of up to 3 students. The midterm report
                            will require at least 6 pages per student. For groups the presentatoin will be
                            15 minutes including time for Q/A. Individual presentations
                            will be 10 minutes including time for Q/A.

							&#9679; <b><i>Final Project</i></b> <br>

							The final project is the largest component of the course.
							Each student will discover, explore, and attack a real world
							problem of your choosing. The detailed description and requirements
							for the final project can be found under the "Final Project" tab.
							<br><br>

							&#9679; <b><i>GitHub</i></b> <br>

							As we stated in the course overview, students are expected to
							become comfortable with Github. Hence, each student is required
							to create a Github account for coding assignment submission and
							final project submission. If you already have a Github account,
							that's perfect. If not, please create a personal Github account
							and go over the tutorials online.<br>
							<i>Note:</i> Please make sure to send the username of your Github
							account to TA for homework grading.
						</p>


						<h3>Classroom Policies:</h3>
						<p>
							&#9679; <b><i>Attendence</i></b> <br>

							Attendence for each lecture is mandatory and is expected of all
							class members. if you're going to miss a lecture, it is neccessary
							for you to inform the instructor as soon as possible. You are also
							responsible for obtaining notes from another class member.
							<br><br>


							&#9679; <b><i>Devices</i></b> <br>

							You are welcome to use your computer or tablet for note-taking
							(the PowerPoint slides will also be posted shortly after the
							lecture for your convenience).
						</p>

						<h3>Diabilities:</h3>
						<p>
							Students who need disability-related accommodations are
							encouraged to discuss this with the instructor as soon as
							possible.
